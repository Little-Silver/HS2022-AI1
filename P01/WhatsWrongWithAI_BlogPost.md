# WhatsWrongWithAI - Blogpost

In this blogpost I will share my opinion on the discussion paper "What's Wrong with AI?", specifically on the "Singularity" paragraph.

The paragraph raises the question whether we can compete with robots in the future. Some people believe the days of humans are counted because they think robots are going to take over. 

Firstly I would like to talk about the design of robots (including its' AI). I personally believe that robots are designed to do specific things or tasks. So unless anyone wants robots to actually take over our society, someone would have to design robots to do just that. This to me seems rather unlikely.

Secondly, will the next wave of automation make a massive number of people unemployed? In the past robots have been designed to automate tasks to do more efficiently than humans ever could. This however hasn't stopped humans from finding other jobs / work that needs to be done. In the past a lot of people used to work in the agriculture sector, nowadays most people either work in the industrial or service sector. In my opinion humans are flexible enough when it comes to employment. There will always be something people want or need that hasn't or couldn't be automated.

As mentioned before I don't think humans will be running out of work to do despite the development of robots and AI. Therefore I also don't think there will be a time where technology enables us to live in a paradise in which we could spend all of our time on friends, hobbies, culture, etc.
