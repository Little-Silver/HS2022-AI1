### AI as God?

An AI itself is not a god, its a "tool" that can be used to influence people to a certain degree. 

### Singularity

Are the days of humans counted?
- I personally don't think they are counted. Both robots and AIs are designed for a specific purpose. Usually to do the work of a human but more efficiently. 

"Superintelligent robots will be as little interested in humans as we are in ants".
- This begs the question whether robots have something like "interest" at all. 

### Transhumanism

While it might be possible to upgrade humans with implanted chips in the future. I don't think this is going to happen any time soon if at all. There are not only technical difficulties but also ethical ones. As far as I know there are already things that could be done biologically far before a human is born. However there are limitations to what is allowed to happen.

### Is AI really intelligent?

What is the definition of intelligence?

### What is Consciousness?

## Can we trust it?

### Big Data Analytics

### Correlation vs. Causality

### Trustable AI

It can definitly be a problem if an AI has a certain result that cannot be explained. Therefore a "trustable AI" would be amazing. It would allow humans to use an AI without having to blindly trust it.

### Profiling, Targeting, and Digital Twins

### Data Protection

### Scoring, Citizen Score, Superscores

### Automation vs. Freedom

### Learning to Die?

### A revolution from above?

## Design for Values

### Human Rights

### Happiness vs. Capitalism

### Human Dignity

### Informational Self-Determination

A very interesting approach. However extremely difficult to implement and sustain. The platform would need to be safeguarded to absolutely anyone. How is it possible to prevent violations?

### Democracy by Design

### Fairness

### Network Effects for Prosperity, Peace and Sustainability
